<h1>Problem Statement:</h1>

The agriculture sector plays a pivotal role in global food production, yet small and medium-sized farmers often face significant challenges in accessing modern and specialized agricultural equipment due to high upfront costs and limited availability. This creates a barrier to adopting efficient farming practices, resulting in decreased productivity, higher operational costs, and environmental inefficiencies.
Existing rental solutions in the agriculture equipment domain are often fragmented, offline, and lack transparency. Farmers struggle to find the right equipment for their specific needs, face uncertainties regarding the quality and maintenance of rented machinery, and encounter logistical challenges in terms of delivery and pickup.
Hence, there is a critical need for a comprehensive and technology-driven agriculture equipment rental platform. Such a platform would address the challenges faced by farmers by providing a transparent, user-friendly, and centralized solution that enables efficient renting of agricultural equipment, contributing to increased productivity, reduced operational costs, and the overall advancement of sustainable farming practices.
